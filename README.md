# CS_ClientTracker
Based upon my previous project using a MERN stack, I wanted to try to create a .NET application in order to populate data into it using my new api.

Things I've Learned
===
+ Using C# forms for the first time.
+ Populating forms with Object data which you can select.
+ Requesting info from a RESTful API using RestSharp
